"Invariant recognition of feature combinations in the visual system"

discrimination between stimuli composed of combinations of shared features with
- transform invariant neurons
 - with a series of hirachical competive networts with local inhibiation
 - convergent connections to each neuron from a topological correspond. region of the preciding layer
 - synaptic plasticity with modified hebb-like rule w/ temporal trace of each cell previous activity

1.2
 - tracing of objects with short term memory associations
