- operators for reconstructing features from images
  (possibly with [handcrafted] scaffolds)
  * triangle
  * quad
  * rectangle
  * etc.

  * 3d (re)construction from motion images

TODO
 - convert to hsl -> convert back only the color -> convert to green/yellow ... colorspace
 
 - NetworkAlgorithm2 : implement and test tunneling (shifting/inserting of elements bfore "walls")
